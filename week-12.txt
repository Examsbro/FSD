Install Django and setup a virtual environment.
Step1: Open command prompt, check version of python

python --version

It is suggested to have a dedicated virtual environment for each Django project, and one way to manage a virtual environment is venv, which is included in Python. 

The name of the virtual environment is your choice, in this tutorial we will call it myworld. 

Type the following in the command prompt, remember to navigate to where you want to create your project:

py -m venv myworld


This will set up a virtual environment, and create a folder named "myworld" with subfolders and files, like this:

myworld 
  Include
  Lib
  Scripts
  pyview.cfg


Then you have to activate the environment, by typing this command:

myworld\Scripts\activate.bat

Once the environment is activated, you will see this result in the command prompt:

(myworld) c:\Users\Your Name>

Install Django:

Django is installed using pip, with this command:

py -m pip install Django

Check Django Version:

django-admin --version

django-admin startproject my_project_name

Django creates a my_project_name folder on my computer, with this content

my_project_name
	manage.py
	my_project_name/
		__init__.py
		asgi.py
		settings.py
		urls.py
		wsgi.py

My First Project: 

Once you have come up with a suitable name for your Django project, like mine: my_tennis_club, navigate to where in the file system you want to store the code (in the virtual environment), I will navigate to the myworld folder, and run this command in the command prompt: 

Run the Django Project
 
Now that you have a Django project, you can run it, and see what it looks like in a browser. 
Navigate to the /my_project_name folder and execute this command in the command prompt:

py manage.py runserver
